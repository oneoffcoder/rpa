Syllables
=========

Each word is composed of ``CVT``. We will list the consonants, vowels and tones here again.

Consonants (54)

::

    c, d, f, h, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, x, y, z
    ch, dh, hl, hm, hn, kh, ml, nc, nk, np, nq, nr, nt, ph, pl, qh, rh, th, ts, tx, xy
    hml, hny, nch, nkh, nph, nqh, nrh, nth, nts, ntx, plh, tsh, txh
    nplh, ntsh, ntxh

Vowels (13)

::

    a, e, i, o, u, w
    ai, au, aw, ee, ia, oo, ua

Tones (7)

::

    j, s, v, m, g, b, _

Pick any single consonant, vowel and tone, and you most likely have spelled a Hmong word, or made a Hmong syllable, at the very least. Let's say we pick 

* ``c`` (as the consonant),
* ``a`` (as the vowel), and
* ``g`` (as the tone).

The spelling ``cag`` is a Hmong word, meaning **root** (as in tree roots) in English.

.. warning::

    We stated previously that there are 5,012 total possible syllables in RPA, however, this number of permutations does not mean that there are only 5,012 total Hmong words. As we stated earlier, there are Hmong words that RPA cannot spell, and, additionally, some words are spelled exactly the same but are completely different words (``homonyms``). An example of a homonym is ``kab`` which may mean ``line`` (as a in straight line) or ``insect``.
    
    Sometimes we will state syllable or word, but the context should make the meaning clear.

From this point onward, creating Hmong words should be fun, as it is as easy as mixing and matching elements from ``C``, ``V`` and ``T``.  The challenge, however, is enunciation, especially with respect to tones. 

.. note::

    It might also help to have a geometric view of the space of possible syllables in RPA. By this, we mean, think of the ``X-Y-Z`` 3-dimensional (``3D``) Cartesian coordinate system. When you move along the ``X``, ``Y`` and ``Z`` axes and stop, you end up with a ``x-y-z`` coordinate in 3D space. Instead of ``X-Y-Z``, replace these axes with ``C-V-T``. Of course, there is no cardinality with the consonants, vowels or tones, but we may order them as we have been doing so along these axes. Traveling along these axes will also map to a ``c-v-t`` coordinate pointing to a unique syllable.
