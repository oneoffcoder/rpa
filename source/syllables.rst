Syllables
=========

Each word is composed of ``CVT``. We will list the consonants, vowels and tones here again.

Consonants (54)

::

    c, d, f, h, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, x, y, z
    ch, dh, hl, hm, hn, kh, ml, nc, nk, np, nq, nr, nt, ph, pl, qh, rh, th, ts, tx, xy
    hml, hny, nch, nkh, nph, nqh, nrh, nth, nts, ntx, plh, tsh, txh
    nplh, ntsh, ntxh

Vowels (13)

::

    a, e, i, o, u, w
    ai, au, aw, ee, ia, oo, ua

Tones (8)

::

    j, s, v, m, g, b, _

Pick any single consonant, vowel and tone, and you most likely have spelled a Hmong word, or made a Hmong syllable, at the very least. Let's say we pick 

* ``c`` (as the consonant),
* ``a`` (as the vowel), and
* ``g`` (as the tone).

The spelling ``cag`` is a Hmong word, meaning **root** (as in tree roots) in English.

.. warning::

    We stated previously that there are 5,733 total possible syllables in RPA, however, this number of permutations does not mean that there are only 5,733 total Hmong words. As we stated earlier, there are Hmong words that RPA cannot spell, and, additionally, some words are spelled exactly the same but are completely different words (``homonyms``). An example of a homonym is ``kab`` which may mean ``line`` (as a in straight line) or ``insect``.
    
    Sometimes we will state syllable or word, but the context should make the meaning clear.

From this point onward, creating Hmong words should be fun, as it is as easy as mixing and matching elements from ``C``, ``V`` and ``T``.  The challenge, however, is enunciation, especially with respect to tones.
