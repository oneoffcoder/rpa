CVT
===

The mental model of RPA is with understanding the so-called ``CVT`` (Consonant, Vowel, Tone) composition of a ``syllable``. For all intents and purposes, a syllable is simply a sound. Hmong is a language, like Madarin, that is largely mono-syllabic; meaning, one sound is one word. Of course, there are multi-syllable words in Hmong too, but, these words themselves are composed of the elementary mono-syllables. After you learn the mono-syllables, this achievement paves the way to learning compound words in Hmong. 

Back to ``CVT``. Simply stated, a ``consonant`` is a the beggining of a word, a ``vowel`` is the middle of a word and a ``tone`` is the ending of a word. For more technical articles of these concepts, see the following `constant <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant>`_, `vowel <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel>`_ and `tone <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_(linguistics)>`_ articles. In RPA, there are only so many consonants, vowels and tones. In fact, there are 

* 54 consonants,
* 13 vowels, and
* 7 tones.

Mathematically, there are 4,914 (:math:`54 \times 13 \times 7`) possible permutations of syllables that may be created using these finite sets of consonants, vowels and tones.

.. note::

    RPA's ``CVT`` approach to creating syllables is not perfect. There are sounds that cannot be captured using the CVT approach. Such sounds include those used in rituals and/or religious activities.

However, some words do not have a consonant. Meaning, we have 91 (:math:`13 \times 7`) possible syllables without a consonant. In all, there are 5,005 (:math:`4,914 + 91`) total possible syllables. 

Going further, some words are just vowels. So, actually, there are 5,012 (:math:`5,005 + 7`) total possible syllables in RPA.

.. note::

    The ``CVT`` mental model of Hmong syllables and/or words is so powerful that many other Hmong writing systems are modeled using this approach. For example, the famous ``Phaj Hauj`` script uses ``TCV`` (the tone comes first) to model writing syllables.
    
Let's dive into the consonants, vowels and tones.
