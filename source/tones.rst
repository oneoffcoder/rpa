Tones
=====

There are 7 tones in RPA. The Hmong language is sometimes called the `tonal champion` of East Asian languages for having so many tones. Compare the Hmong language with 7 tones to Madarin, which has 4 tones. The tones are as follows.

* j
* s
* v
* m
* g
* b
* _

.. warning::

    The tone represented by the underscore ``_`` is really blank, but denoted here with an underscore to make it explicit. The underscore is never used to represent a tone and will be omitted later; the context will make it clear.
