.. note::

    Hmong first names are typically mono-syllabic. For a male, when he has come of age (married with children), he will undergo a renaming ceremony to change his name. During this ceremony, he will receive an additional syllable to his existing name, or in any case, his first name will be bi-syllabic. Typically, however, an additionally syllable is added as a prefix. For example, a common Hmong male name is ``Pov``. When he has come of age, his wife and him will undergo a renaming ceremony and his new name might be ``Txawj Pov``, ``Nkaj Pov`` or ``Tooj Pov``.

.. warning:: 

    If you are a person of stature or prestige, others and yourself, will introduce you with last name first, first name last. For example, if your first name is ``Pov`` and your last name is ``Vaj`` and you are a non-insignificant person, you will go by ``Vaj Pov`` instead of ``Pov Vaj``.

    This custom is counter to the way ethnic Han people introduce themselves, which is always last name first, first name last, regardless of stature or prestige. In Hmong culture and practice, unless you are someone established and approved by the community at large, you should always introduce yourself first name first and last name last. 

.. note::

    If you want to use a Hmong last name, you only have 18 to choose from. For the most part, Hmong people acknowledge 18 last names (sometimes referred to as clans), although there are many more; but, these are the 18 predominant ones. Here's the list.
