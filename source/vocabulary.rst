Months
^^^^^^

.. csv-table:: Calendar months
    :header: English, Hmong

    January, Ib Hli
    February, Ob Hli
    March, Peb Hli
    April, Plaub Hli
    May, Tsib Hli

    August, Yim Hli
    September, Cuaj Hli
    October, Kaum Hli
    November, Kaum Ib Hli
    December, Kaum Ob Hli

.. note::

    The word ``hli`` means ``moon`` in English. Essentially, the month names are counting the moon cycles; moon one, moon two, etc.

.. note::

    Sometimes, you may add ``ntuj`` to state the month as well. For example, ``ib hli ntuj``, ``ob hli ntuj``, etc.

Days of the week
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. csv-table:: Days of the week
    :header: English, Hmong

    Monday, Hnub Ib
    Tuesday, Hnub Ob
    Wednesday, Hnub Peb
    Thursday, Hnub Plaub
    Friday, Hunb Tsib
    Saturday, Vas Xaum
    Sunday, Vas Thiv

.. warning::

    Saturday and Sunday are borrowed from Lao and transliterations thereof. ``Vas Xaum`` is a transliteration of ``vansao`` or ``ວັນເສົາ`` and ``Vas Thiv`` of ``vnaothid`` or ``ວັນອາທິດ``. There are no real way to say Monday through Friday in Hmong and the days of the week stated here have absolutely no support from the community or any known linguist. We are simply following convention with the months. 

    A week in Hmong is ``as thiv`` which is borrowed from Lao ``athid`` or ``ອາທິດ``. Some speakers are also using ``lis paim`` for the word week, which is a transliteration of Mandarin word ``lǐ bài`` or ``礼拜``.

Day
^^^

To say the day (e.g. first, second, etc.), use ``hnub`` followed by the number. For example, the first is ``hnub ib``, the second is ``hnub ob``, and so on. 

.. note::

    ``Hnub`` means ``sun`` in English. Is it not interesting months correlate to the moon and days correspond to the sun? 

Day passage
^^^^^^^^^^^

There are ways to say the day before yesterday or the day after tomorrow. 

.. csv-table::

    the day before yesterday, hnub hmo
    yesterday, nag hmo
    today, hnub no

    the day after tomorrow, nag kis

The cycle of the day may be described as follows.

.. csv-table::
    :header: English, Hmong

    morning, tag kis no
    afternoon, tav su
    night, hmo ntuj

Year
^^^^

The Hmong word for year is ``xyoo``. To say the year 2019, simply say the number after ``xyoo``; for example, ``xyoo ob phav kaum cuaj``. Note that is uncommon to say ``xyoo ob txhiab kaum cuaj`` (substituting ``txhiab`` for ``phav``). 

Calendar examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here are some calendar examples.

.. csv-table::
    :header: Date, Hmong

    "December 25, 2019", "kaum ob hli ntuj, hnub nees nkaum tsib, xyoo ob phav kaum cuaj"

Time is told the same way as in English. The table below shows the words for hour and minute.

.. csv-table::
    :header: English, Hmong

    hour, teev
    minute, nas this

.. note::

    The word ``nas this`` is borrowed from Lao ``nathi`` or ``ນາທີ``. Commonly, the word ``moos`` can be substituted for ``teev``, and this word is borrowed from Lao ``souaomng`` or ``ຊົ່ວໂມງ``. Note that ``teev`` is phonetically identical to the Mandarin word ``diǎn`` or ``點``.

Family relationships
--------------------

Here are some very important family relationships. The title that you will use to address a person depends on at least one of the following.

* your gender
* the side of the family that person falls on (father's or mother's side)
* age of that person with respect to your parents

For example, note that there are many ways to say sister. If you are a boy, you refer to your sister as ``muam``. If you are a girl, you refer to your older sister as ``niam laus`` and younger sister as ``niam hluas`` and all of them as ``viv ncaus``. These rules are very strict. The table below shows the titles of the family members closest to you.

This table shows the titles of your paternal grandfathers.

    :header: English, Hmong

    Grandfather, Yawg
    Great-grandfather, Yawg Koob
    Great-great-grandfather, Yawg Suab
    Great-great-great-grandfather, Yawg Tsawb

These are just some of many titles which you should refer to people related to yourself. 

.. note::

    What's the Hmong word for ``cousin``? The phrase ``tij yug kwv yug`` may be used to indicate that two people are cousins. ``Tij yug`` means descended from the older brother, and ``kwv yug`` means descended from the younger brother; meaning, the two people in question do not share the same parents but are related still. Sometimes, to clarify that two people are descended from the same parents, it is common to say ``niam txiv ib plab yug`` which means literally, ``mother-father one stomach descended`` (descended from a single set of parents). 

If you have children, it is customary to refer to people as what your children refer to them as. For example, if you are a male, you refer to your sister's husband as ``yuam yij``. When you have children, your children will call your brother-in-law (their uncle) as ``yawg laus``, and you should do so as well.
